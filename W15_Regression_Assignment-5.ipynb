    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines the strengths of Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. It introduces a penalty term that is a linear combination of the L1 and L2 norms of the coefficients. This allows it to achieve feature selection (like Lasso) while also maintaining numerical stability (like Ridge).      \n",
