        "**Purpose :-**  In machine learning, hyperparameters are settings that determine the learning process of a model. They are not learned from the data itself but are set before training. Finding the optimal combination of hyperparameters can significantly impact a model's performance. Grid Search CV is a technique that automates this process by systematically exploring different combinations of hyperparameter values.\n",
